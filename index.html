<p>As a developer of <a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/gr-gsm/"><code>gr-gsm</code></a> project - a <code>GNU Radio</code> based software for receiving GSM signal - I always thought that it would be great to have a multiple channels receiver that would be available for everyone. The reason is that it would be possible to do more with my software for all users who are interested in giving it a try and not only those who can afford a multichannel device like an <code>USRP</code>. For example: with two channel receiver it would be possible to receive uplink of a GSM channel in addition to downlink. To achieve this with <code>USRPs N200</code> two devices synchronized with a special cable are required. Total price of such solution is about 4 thousand dollars - too big amount for someone who starts journey with software defined radio and who at the same time might be interested in <code>gr-gsm</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gr-gsm/4YiTK4WqFvs/BycVCdvNBwAJ">I was reluctant</a> to implement a cheap receiver with multiple RF channels myself. I thought that it was a matter of a short time before someone demonstrate a working solution transforming cheap <code>RTL-SDR</code> dongles (digital television receivers re-purposed to act as a software radio receivers) into a multi-channel receiver. I had good reasons to think that it will eventually happen. There was already some important work done on this subject, starting with <a href="http://kaira.sgo.fi/2013/09/16-dual-channel-coherent-digital.html">Juha Vierinen's idea</a> to synchronize clocks of multiple <code>RTL-SDR</code> receivers, so they were sampling with exactly the same rate.</p>

<p>What was missing was time-synchronization between <code>RTL-SDR</code> dongles. When you start multiple <code>RTL-SDR</code> dongles at the roughly the same moment there always will be random delays (changing from one program start to another) between the sample streams coming from different receiver. YO3IIU <a href="http://yo3iiu.ro/blog/?p=1450">presented</a> synchronization of the receivers working on the same frequency with use of cross-correlation of the signals coming from many receivers. It was done off-line - on files with the captured signal stored to disk - and no way to synchronize channels that work on different frequencies was demonstrated. This way it wasn't possible to capture for example GSM uplink and downlink synchronously as they are on different frequencies with large (at 45MHz for GSM900) separation.</p>

<p>So time passed but somehow no ready-made solution materialized. At some point (beginning of December 2015) I decided that some effort from my side might be required in order to speed up this process a bit.</p>

<p>Before I decided to code time-synchronization myself <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/gr-gsm/4YiTK4WqFvs/VsFBpDoXCQAJ">I have already shown</a> that <code>RTL-SDR</code> receivers keep time-synchronization across re-tunings to different carrier frequencies. I will show it again here with a bit more of the background information.</p>

<p>I've coded the test so it first started with recording a signal on a GSM C0 (BCCH) frequency, then it switched to another central frequency where only noise was present and in the end it switched back to the same GSM C0 frequency. The GSM signal's amplitude is periodic with the period of 156.25us - equal to the duration of one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Um_interface#Radio_modem">GSM TDMA time slot</a>. Each GSM burst transmitted inside of time slot has constant amplitude. After a burst there is always 8.25us long guard period when signal amplitude decreases to 0. If you sample the signal with <code>4*gsm_symbold_rate=4*1625000/6=1.08333... MHz</code> the length of a time slot in samples is 625. The easy way giving indication that the signal didn't loose synchronization is to look if guard periods are in the expected positions. In order to do this graphically I've cut the signal into blocks of the length of a single time slot, created a matrix with consecutive bursts in the rows and plotted the matrix as an image with pixels intensity representing amplitude. The result can be observed on the image below:
<img src="images/rtl_retune_sync_check.jpg" alt="RTL-SDR retune synchronization test"></p>

<p>You can first see the amplitude of the GSM signal, then amplitude of noise and in the end amplitude of the GSM signal again. What can be seen is that guard periods after two retunes of a <code>RTL-SDR</code> receiver are aligned. The same situation repeated for all recordings I made. Synchronization is kept. Hurray!</p>

<p>This experiment had shown that it is possible to time-synchronize multiple <code>RTL-SDR</code> dongles working on different frequencies with very simple means:</p>

<ul>
<li>tuning the <code>RTL-SDR</code> dongles to the same frequency where some transmission is present,</li>
<li>recording a short signals with all of the dongles,</li>
<li>computing cross-correlation of the signals (i.e. with respect to a one selected channel),</li>
<li>finding position of maximums of cross-correlations in order to estimate relative delays of the channels,</li>
<li>correcting the delays so the channels are time-synchronized,</li>
<li>switching the dongles to their target frequencies,</li>
<li>changing other parameters of the channels (like gains) to target values.</li>
</ul>

<p>What was left was to get hands dirty and implement a program that does all these steps. I decided that the simplest way to implement the software was to create a GNU Radio hierarchical block that uses multiple <code>RTL-SDR</code> source blocks (created by <a href="http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/GrOsmoSDR">osmocom project</a>) - one for each dongle comprising a channel. </p>

<p>First I wanted to do everything with use of Python only. I used off the shelf vetor sink block to get signals samples to Python. Then the delays were and then reconfigured the flowgrap in order to disconnect the vector sinks - so they don't save samples indefinitely. This solution proved to be wrong as after each reconfiguration of the flowgraph relative delays of channels changed randomly. </p>

<p>In order to avoid modifying the path that I've chosen initially too much I decided to change vector sink block's C++ code so it fit the needs. I've extendded number of input channels (from one to any number), added possibility to limit the number of sample collected, and added call to a callback function when this number is reached. The callback function takes samples stored for each channel and does the steps described previously, needed in order to synchronize the received streams. Most of the work was done during winter break - until 12'th January 2016. The resulting hierarchical <code>GNU Radio</code> block is called <code>Multi-RTL</code>.</p>

<p>The example of recording with a two channel <code>Multi-RTL</code> receiver is shown at the pictures below. The recorded was GSM signal and the result is presented in the same way as previously - with amplitude of a signal in GSM time-slots plotted as horizontal lines of pixels in the images. At the beginning there is synchronization phase when the signals coming from input 1 and input 2 of the receiver are not aligned in time yet. At this moment delay between input 1 and input 2 is calculated and at the end correction is applied to the input 2. From that moment inputs of the receiver are synchronized.

<p>In October 2015 Teejez has uploaded to the github his <a href="https://github.com/tejeez/rtl_coherent">rtl_coherent</a> project - software that automatizes synchronization between receivers working on the same frequency, with some additional hardware modifications required. He used additional synchronization signal that is introduced through switching of receivers' RF inputs, to connect them to common noise signal generator and then reconnect them to antennas. I was made aware of <code>rtl_coherent</code> project only recently - when I was finishing to write this text.</p>

<p>The usage of the block is presented in the <a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/multi-rtl/tree/master#usage">project's readme</a>. Here I will present the example of the use of <code>Multi-RTL</code> source block for synchronous reception of downlink and uplink of a GSM C0 channel. As a prerequisite two <code>RTL-SDR</code> dongles are needed. </p>

<p>The next step is not obligatory, but it will enable identification of the receiver's channels:</p>

<ul>
<li>connect the first receiver and change its serial number with the following command:
rtl_eeprom -d 0 -s 00000001</li>
<li>mark the dongle to know that it is the first one,</li>
<li>disconnect the dongle,</li>
<li>connect the secon one and change its serial number with the following command:
rtl_eeprom -d 0 -s 00000002</li>
<li>mark the dongle so you know that it's the second one.</li>
</ul>

<p>The basic prerequisite is to synchronize clocks of the dongles. In order to do that remove the oscillator form the second dongle and connect the two dongles according to the photo below:
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ptrkrysik/multi-rtl/master/docs/images/dongles_with_common_clock.jpg" alt="dongles with common clock"></p>

<p>The assembled receiver with antennas and a USB hub is shown below:
<img src="images/multi_rtl_receiver_sm.jpg" alt="Complete receiver"></p>

<p>I've created a sample gnuradio-companion application (<a href="">mutlirtl_rx_to_cfile_2chan.grc</a>) that enables two channel reception and storing the signals to files. Its flow-graph is presented below. It is very simple - there is <code>Multi-RTL</code> source configured to work with two channels then there are head blocks limiting number of recorded samples and in the end for each of the channels signals are stored to files with use of file sink blocks.</p>

<p><img src="images/multi_rx_to_cfile_2chan.png" alt="Sample two channel application using Multi-RTL"></p>

<p>In the example there was downlink of the C0 carrier frequency at 939.4MHz (<code>freq-ch0</code>). Uplink of that radio channel was at 894.4MHz (<code>freq-ch1</code>) as uplink-downlink separation for GSM900 is 45MHz. For synchronization downlink of the <code>C0</code> channel can be used (<code>sync-freq</code> option is therefore 939.4MHz), because it provides good enough accuracy for this application. As sampling frequency (<code>samp-rate</code>) <code>4*GSM_symbol_rate=4*1625000/6=1083333.3333(...)</code> was be used. Gains were set to <code>30 dB</code> for downlink and <code>10dB</code> for the uplink (<code>gain-ch0</code>, <code>gain-ch1</code>). Synchronization gains were set to the same value <code>30dB</code> (<code>sync-gain-ch0</code>, <code>sync-gain-ch1</code>). Samples of the signals were stored to <code>downlink.cfile</code> (<code>fname-ch0</code>) and <code>uplink.cfile</code> (<code>fname-ch1</code>). Finally the program was invoked with following options:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./multi-rtl/examples/mutlirtl_rx_to_cfile_2chan.py --ch0-id-string=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>00000001<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> --ch1-id-string=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>00000002<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> --samp-rate 1083333.3333333333 --freq-ch0 939.4M --freq-ch1 894.4M --sync-freq 939.4e6 --gain-ch0 30 --gain-ch1 10 --sync-gain-ch0 30 --sync-gain-ch1 30 --fname-ch0 downlink.cfile --fname-ch1 uplink.cfile</pre></div>

<p>During the recording I've sent an SMS with my phone that was working on the recorded frequency. The resulting files (renamed to <code>sms_multirtl_downlink_tail.cfile</code> and <code>sms_multirtl_uplink_tail.cfile</code>) can be downloaded with use of the links below:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/test_data/raw/master/sms_multirtl_downlink_tail.cfile">downlink capture file</a>,</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/test_data/raw/master/sms_multirtl_uplink_tail.cfile">uplink capture file</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I could recover the key used for my own call/SMS I was able to decode the encrypted part of the traffic with the SMS content. To decode the signal <a href="https://github.com/ptrkrysik/gr-gsm/wiki/Installation">installation of gr-gsm</a> is required. After that copy the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ptrkrysik/examples/master/uplink_decoding_demo/uplink_decoding_multi_rtl.py">uplink_decoding_multi_rtl.py</a> script from <code>gr-gsm</code>'s examples to the directory where the capture files are located. Then start <code>Wireshark</code>:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>wireshark -k -f udp -Y gsmtap -i lo <span class="pl-k">&amp;</span></pre></div>

<p>and run the script that does decryption and decoding:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>./uplink_decoding_multi_rtl.py</pre></div>

<p><code>Wireshark</code> should capture the decoded messages enabling analysis of the frames. Among them there is an SMS sent from the mobile station in the uplink channel. It is possible to view the content of the SMS in <code>Wireshark</code> like it is shown on theimage below:

<a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

<p><code>Multi-RTL</code> adds time-synchronization to <code>RTL-SDR</code> receivers sharing a common clock. There are many possible use-cases of this capability. </p>

<p>For example - multiple receiving channels can be working on the same frequency. This enables applications like passive radar. One dongle can be connected to the antenna picking up reference signal and other receivers can be connected to antennas gathering objects' echoes. This possibility was shown by <a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/06/05/building-your-own-sdr-based-passive-radar-on-a-shoestring/">Juha Vierinen</a>. Time synchronization was (most probably) done in off-line processing - which is very fine for a proof of concept but not convenient for an user application. </p>

<p>Regarding Teejez's <a href="https://github.com/tejeez/rtl_coherent">rtl_coherent</a> - it achieves the goal of synchronizing multiple RTL-SDR receivers working on the same central frequency but it requires additional noise source and switches to synchronize RTL-SDR receivers working on the same frequency. <code>Multi-RTL</code> receiver is simpler because it uses frequency switching (no RF switches required) and for synchronization it utilizes signals available in the air (additional generator is not necessary). Having a synchronization signal source that you control might be valuable for reliability of time-difference estimation but it increases cost a bit and adds some complication that might be harder to overcome by the newcomers.</p>

<p><strong>With <code>Multi-RTL</code> all RX channels can also work synchronously on different central frequencies</strong>. Addition of this capability is the most original contribution that <code>Multi-RTL</code> brings to <code>RTL-SDR</code> world and it achieves that goal with simple and universal means. This makes possible many applications where received signals are spread over frequency range that exceeds maximum sampling rate of a single <code>RTL-SDR</code> receiver, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>reception of GSM downlink and uplink simultaneously,</li>
<li>reception of transmissions that use frequency hopping (like GSM hopping channels).</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Multi-RTL</code> also opens the way for works on coherent aggregation of bandwidth of multiple <code>RTL-SDR</code> receivers in order to receive signals with bandwidth wider than sampling rate of a single receiver. </p>

<p>What is left to be done in the <code>Multi-RTL</code> is to add automatic resynchronization whenever some interruption in the communication with any of the receivers occurs. Currently an overflow of a buffer in a <code>RTL-SDR</code> receiver causes synchronization loss, until user call resynchronization function himself. <code>Multi-RTL</code> needs some way to know from <code>osmocom source</code> that an overflow happened. <code>osmocom source</code> doesn't inform <code>GNU Radio</code> blocks connected to it about communication problems yet, but it could send this information downstream with use of <code>GNU Radio</code>'s stream tags.</p>
